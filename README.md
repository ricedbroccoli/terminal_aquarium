This is a project I made for the Terminalcraft YSWS

It has small fish drawn in ASCII art floating around at random through the tank, and will shape itself to the size of your terminal window.

Instructions:

### 1) Make sure you install Python 3

### 2) Clone the repo from GitHub

### 3) Extract the repository file

### 4) Go to the location of the extracted repository in your terminal

###  5) Enter the following command:


```
python3 main.py
```


### 6) Enjoy the aquarium

I chose this project specifically because I love fishtank screen savers. Fish swimming around is just calming to me. So why not make one inside the terminal?
