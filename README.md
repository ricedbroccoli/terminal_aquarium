This is a small project I made for the Terminalcraft YSWS

It has small fish drawn in ASCII art floating around at random through the tank, and will shape itself to the size of your terminal window.

Instructions:

### 1) Clone the repo from GitHub

### 2) Extract the repository file

### 3) Go to the location of the extracted repository in your terminal

###  4) Enter the following command:


```
python3 main.py
```


### 5) Enjoy the aquarium
